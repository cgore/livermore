\subsection{Background}
The system presented here is derived from Wilson's XCSR, which is an extension of Wilson's XCS, which in turn was derived from Wilson's ZCS.
ZCS, XCS, XCSR, and this system are all learning classifier systems (LCS's), a crossover of the fields of evolutionary computation (EC) and reinforcement learning (RL), both of which are quite large fields on their own.
We will describe in this section the previous works this system was built upon.

\subsubsection{Learning Classifier Systems}
A learning classifier system is a type of EA in which a description of a current situation is used in an attempt to map that description to some classification or action.
This is achieved through simulated evolutionary processes, where the population being evolved consists of various rules;
our entire population forms a rule set, and we apply concepts from Darwinism to our individual rules.
This is known in learning classifiers as the \emph{Michigan approach} \cite{EibenSmith}.
The other primary method employed, where each individual is an entire solution, and therefore a whole rule set, is known as the \emph{Pittsburgh approach}.
We use a modification of XCSR here, which uses the Michigan approach, and therefore so do we.
