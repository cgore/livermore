\subsubsection{GA Thresholds}
After deciding on $a_2$ as the best reward method and keeping it for the rest of these tests, we turn our attention to optimizing the GA threshold $\theta_{GA}$, which is described earlier in \S\ref{sec:ga-threshold}.
We chose to look at the possible values for this parameter of 25,  35, 45, and 50.

A GA threshold of 25 was used in the previous situation, so we can borrow the results from that $a_2$ run; refer to Table~\ref{tab:reward-a2}.

For a GA threshold value of 35, we observed the results as described in Table~\ref{tab:gathreshold35} over 30 trials.

For a GA threshold value of 45, we observed the results as described in Table~\ref{tab:gathreshold45} over 31 trials.

\end{cgoreErt}

For a GA threshold value of 50, we observed the results as described in Table~\ref{tab:gathreshold50} over 30 trials.

\begin{cgoreErt}{TSC results for a GA threshold of 50.}{tab:gathreshold50}
arith mean & 763 & 50.891\% & \$1,885,079.90 & 0.68665 & 11.28\%pa \\
std dev & 21.1 & 1.405\% & \$293,885.56 & 0.10705 & 1.76\%pa \\
max & 808 & 53.867\% & \$2,425,741.30 & 0.88359 & 16.10\%pa \\

\end{cgoreErt}

There was no significant effect on the results of the algorithm based on the GA threshold: all of the other means fall well within $1\over4$ of a standard deviation relative to the initial value of $\theta_{GA} = 25$, so we will employ that value for all remaining experiments.
