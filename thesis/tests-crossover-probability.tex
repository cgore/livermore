\subsubsection{Crossover Probabilities}
After deciding on the correct reward method and the correct GA threshold, using those results, we investigated the crossover probability, which is described earlier in \S\ref{sec:crossover-probability}.
We chose to look at 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9.

For a crossover probability of $\chi = 0.3$, we obtained the results as described in Table~\ref{tab:chi0.3} over 33 trials.

\begin{cgoreErt}{TSC results for $\chi=0.3$.}{tab:chi0.3}
arith mean & 755 & 50.358\% & \$1,862,015.40 & 0.67825 & 11.05\%pa \\
std dev & 24.3 & 1.621\% & \$213,367.14 & 0.07772 & 1.27\%pa \\
max & 829 & 55.267\% & \$2,354,066.50 & 0.85749 & 15.52\%pa \\
min & 712 & 47.467\% & \$1,313,611.90 & 0.47849 & 4.71\%pa
\end{cgoreErt}

For a crossover probability of $\chi = 0.5$, we obtained the results as described in Table~\ref{tab:chi0.5} over 31 trials.

\begin{cgoreErt}{TSC results for $\chi=0.5$.}{tab:chi0.5}
arith mean & 754 & 50.275\% & \$1,882,082.30 & 0.68556 & 11.25\%pa \\
std dev & 24.9 & 1.662\% & \$265,281.13 & 0.09663 & 1.59\%pa \\
max & 799 & 53.267\% & \$2,426,894.30 & 0.88401 & 16.11\%pa \\
min & 717 & 47.8 & \$1,354,985.40 & 0.49356 & 5.25\%pa
\end{cgoreErt}

For a crossover probability of $\chi = 0.7$, we obtained the results as described in Table~\ref{tab:chi0.7} over 34 trials.

\begin{cgoreErt}{TSC results for $\chi=0.7$.}{tab:chi0.7}
arith mean & 754 & 50.275\% & \$1,884,173.30 & 0.68632 & 11.27\%pa \\
std dev & 28.9 & 1.930\% & \$258,017.90 & 0.09399 & 1.54\%pa \\
max & 809 & 53.933\% & \$2,526,742.80 & 0.92039 & 16.90\%pa \\
min & 688 & 45.867\% & \$1,264,236.40 & 0.46051 & 4.03\%pa
\end{cgoreErt}

A crossover probability of 0.8 was used in the previous situation, so we can borrow the results from the $\theta_{GA} = 25$ run; refer to Table~\ref{tab:reward-a2}.

For a crossover probability of $\chi = 0.9$, we obtained the results as described in Table~\ref{tab:chi0.9} over 39 trials.

\begin{cgoreErt}{TSC results for $\chi=0.9$.}{tab:chi0.9}
arith mean & 759 & 50.626\% & \$1,943,606.10 & 0.70797 & 11.85\% \\
std dev & 21.9 & 1.462\% & \$277,516.22 & 0.10109 & 1.69\%  \\
max & 801 & 53.400\% & \$2,399,683.00 & 0.87410 & 15.89\% \\
min & 707 & 47.133\% & \$1,419,889.40 & 0.51721 & 6.09\%
\end{cgoreErt}

We can now easily observe that a crossover probability of $\chi=0.9$ offers the best results with an arithmetic mean of 11.85\%pa, and we employ it for all of the remaining experiments.
